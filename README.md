## 📌 About
This project simulates a **harmless ransomware attack** for **educational and research purposes**. It demonstrates file encryption techniques in a controlled, reversible, and fully transparent environment.  

> 💡 Designed for cybersecurity learners, ethical hackers, and teachers.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧮 Disguised as a simple calculator interface
- 🔐 Simulated file encryption (no actual data loss)
- 🗝️ Real-time decryption with key validation
- 💾 Secure local backups created automatically
- 📘 Transparent logging of all operations
- 🛑 Ethical warnings and non-malicious by design

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ransomware-simulator.git
cd ransomware-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ✅ Python 3.8 or newer required

---

## 🖥️ How to Use

### 🔒 Simulate Encryption (via Calculator)
```bash
python main.py
```
1. Use the calculator as normal.
2. Upon exiting, choose files to "encrypt".
3. Encrypted versions are saved and backups stored in `Desktop/You_Got_Hacked`.

### 🔓 Decrypt Files
```bash
python decrypt.py
```
1. Enter the key shown during encryption.
2. Select files for restoration.
3. Files are recovered from safe backups.
